Program Description 

This program is a two-part program that will discuss my theory of data graphics and discuss an introduction to machine learning.  Both parts of my talk will have hands on learning and programming using R and RStudio.  

# Data Visuals

Everyone wants to be able to tell a story, and persuasive storytelling is an important part of an attorney’s role.  This program is designed to teach  proper data visualization techniques to tell a more powerful story.  The program will cover the 4 Os (Observable, Original, Objective, and Open) of great graphics and how you can portray a better story using data visualizations.   Specifically, the program will cover 1) How to use facts and information in pictorial form; 2) Useful graphic techniques; 3) Good and bad data visual methods, pitfalls, and other considerations when creating or analyzing a graph; and 4) basics of ggplot2() using R to make a great visual. 

# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a series of highly sophisicated statisitcal techniques that is hard to discern and even harder to implement correctly with meaning.  This program is is designed to break open the black box of Machine Learning, so participants can understand the basics of telling their story based on the data and the model, setting up their data, developing a training and testing dataset, validating their model, and, most importantll, explaining the meaning of their model to a wider audience.
